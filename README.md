# mempoolsync-analysis
Just a few python scripts to test mempoolsync's effectiveness

The png pictures should be where you start. new_transactions_data.png shows how many of the transactions (up to 1,000) were new. Additionally, position.png displays the percentage of transactions in a given position that were new. 

mempoolsyncparser.py will create tx-info.xls, and from that one can create the new_transactions_data.png picture. ways_to_sort_txes.py will create position_correlation.xls, and from that one can make position.png.
